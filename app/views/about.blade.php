			<p>FPS was established in 2013 with the aim of providing dedicated affordable programming solutions to a small number of long term clients.</p>
			<p>FPS consists of one UK based account manager and a small team of off shore developers. We do not
               want to expand to a point where we are unable to either provide a personal touch or put ourselves
               under pressure to get new clients.</p>
              <p>We just want to look after a small number of long term clients who do not want to pay agency rates
                 or have enough work to justify taking on permanent developers.</p>
